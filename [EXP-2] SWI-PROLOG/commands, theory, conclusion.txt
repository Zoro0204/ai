THEORY:
Prolog is a general purpose logic programming language associated with artificial
intelligence and computational linguistics.
Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming
languages, Prolog is declarative: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented
as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. Prolog is
well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching
databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.

CONCLUSION:
Demonstration and implementation of arithmetic operations, rules and facts, relationship is done
using SWI-Prolog software. Semantics and syntax of prolog language is well understood. Logical
programming concepts required to execute aritificial intelligence problem is well understood.
