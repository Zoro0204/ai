THEORY:
An agent is something that perceives and acts in an environment. The agent function for an agent
specifies the action taken by the agent in response to any percept sequence. An agent is anything
that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment
through actuators.

PEAS specify the setting of an intelligent agent:
• P: The performance measure defines degree of success.
• E: What does the agent know about the environment?
• A: The actions that the agent can perform.
• S: Everything that an agent as perceived so far through its sensors.

Robot : PEAS
Agent: Part-picking robot
Performance measure: Percentage of parts in correct bins
Environment: Convey p, or belt with parts, bins
Actuators: Jointed arm and hand
Sensors: Camera, joint angle sensors

Medical Example: PEAS
Agent: Medical diagnosis system
Performance measure: Healthy patient, minimize costs, lawsuits
Environment: Patient, p, hospital, staff
Actuators: Screen display (questions, tests, diagnoses, treatments, referrals)
Sensors: Keyboard (entry of symptoms, findings, patient's answers)

CONCLUSION:
For any given problem for a particular agent the required performance measure to measure the
accuracy of an agent, the environment behaviour of an agent, the sensors required to receive the
input from environment and the actuators required to perform the task is carefully observed and
analysed.
