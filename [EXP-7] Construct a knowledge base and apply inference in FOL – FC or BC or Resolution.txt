THEORY:
KNOWLEDGE-BASED AGENT
A Knowledge Base (KB) is, informally a set of sentences, each sentence is expressed in a
“knowledge representation language” and it represents some assertion about the world.
Features of a KB:
• It is possible to add new sentences and to query what is known (the tasks are called TELL
and ASK)
• Deriving new sentences from old ones is called inference
• The new sentences are based on the knowledge already known to the KB, which was
TELLed to the KB previously

CONCLUSION:
Thus we have studied knowledge representation techniques and
working ofknowledge based agent.
